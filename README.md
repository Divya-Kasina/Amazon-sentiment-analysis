# amazon-sentiment-analysis
Introduction :

Online reviews influence purchasing decisions. 
Sentiment analysis helps in understanding customer feedback. 
Machine learning models can classify reviews as positive or negative based on textual data. 
This project explores multiple ML models to analyze product reviews effectively. 
Key Terms: 

1. Sentiment Analysis: Process of determining the sentiment of text data. 

2. Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined labels (positive/negative). 

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI-driven language processing 
 
Problem statement and objectives 

In real- time the manual analysis is inefficient in sentiment analysis. It is facing challenges as 
it has large volume of reviews and it is time consuming and inefficient.  It needs automation. 
Main Goals of the Project: 

1.Develop a sentiment classification model using machine learning. 

2.Analyze product reviews and classify them as positive or negative. 

3.Compare different ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, 
XGBoost, Random Forest). 

4. Use word clouds and data visualization to interpret customer feedback.
   
5.Improve model accuracy through text preprocessing and feature engineering.
